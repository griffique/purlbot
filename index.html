    <h2>Let PurlBot generate a basic pattern customized to you.</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever found a stash of yarn left over from another project and
      thought, "what can I make with this?" You probably then browse through
      countless patterns trying to find something that works with your materials
      and gauge. That's where <strong> PurlBot </strong> is different. You tell
      PurlBot a little bit about your project and we'll generate a basic pattern
      for you. Then you can customize with whatever cables, bobbles, or special
      stitches you want--just make sure to take this into account when you make
      your swatch (see below).
    </p>
    <h3>Preparing to Use PurlBot</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose your yarn and determine approximately how many yards you have.
      </li>
      <li>Check the yarn label for suggested needle size.</li>
      <li>
        Using the yarn and needles you've chosen, knit a gauge swatch of at
        least 4" x 4" in the stitch you intend to use for your project.*
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine the number of stitches you knit in one inch, both horizontally
        and vertically. This is your gauge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use PurlBot to see what you can make and generate a custom pattern!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      *This is important because the stitch may change your gauge. A cable
      pattern, for example, will make it tighter, while a lace pattern often
      makes it looser. For more on gauge, see

    <h1>Generate Your Pattern</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you want to knit?</li>
      <li>
        On your gauge swatch, how many stitches do you count
        <strong> horizontally </strong> in one inch?
      </li>
