            Have you ever found a stash of yarn left over from another project
            and thought, "what can I make with this?" You probably then browse
            through countless patterns trying to find something that works with
            your materials and gauge. That's where <strong> PurlBot </strong> is
            different. You tell PurlBot a little bit about your project and
            we'll generate a basic pattern for you. Then you can customize with
            whatever cables, bobbles, or special stitches you want--just make
            sure to take this into account when you make your swatch (see
            below).

      <h3>Preparing to Use PurlBot</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Choose your yarn and determine approximately how many yards you have.
        </li>
        <li>Check the yarn label for suggested needle size.</li>
        <li>
          Using the yarn and needles you've chosen, knit a gauge swatch of at
          least 4" x 4" in the stitch you intend to use for your project.*
        </li>
        <li>
          Determine the number of stitches you knit in one inch, both
          horizontally and vertically. This is your gauge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use PurlBot to see what you can make and generate a custom pattern!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        *This is important because the stitch may change your gauge. A cable
        pattern, for example, will make it tighter, while a lace pattern often
        makes it looser. For more on gauge, see
